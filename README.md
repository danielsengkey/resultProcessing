# resultProcessing
This is a sample project of using R to process OMNeT++ simulation results.
I use this as a sample project to teach my students how to conduct analysis from OMNeT++ by using GNU R.
Please note although I use several statistical methods in the R scripts, the goal is merely as examples only.
Therefore you need to read statisticis literatures to find the method that suits your purpose.
